# CSS Properties Playground

This project provides a CSS properties playground where you can experiment with various CSS properties and see their effects in real-time.

## Getting Started

To get started with the playground, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

The playground consists of a set of CSS properties that you can modify and observe the changes in the accompanying demo elements. Here are the available properties:

- **Color**: Sets the color of the text.
- **Background-color**: Sets the background color of an element.
- **Font-size**: Sets the size of the text.
- **Font-weight**: Sets the boldness of the text.
- **Text-align**: Sets the alignment of the text within its container.
- **Padding**: Sets the space between the content of an element and its border.
- **Margin**: Sets the space outside the border of an element.
- **Border**: Sets the width, style, and color of an element's border.
- **Width**: Sets the width of an element.
- **Height**: Sets the height of an element.
- **Background-image**: Sets one or more background images for an element.
- **Opacity**: Sets the transparency of an element.
- **Text-decoration**: Sets the decorations applied to the text.
- **Transform**: Applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element.
- **Box-shadow**: Adds a shadow effect to an element.

For each property, there is an input field where you can enter the desired value. The corresponding demo element will update in real-time as you modify the value.
